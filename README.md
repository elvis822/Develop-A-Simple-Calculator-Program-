# Develop-A-Simple-Calculator-Program-
This project involves creating a simple calculator program in Phyton. This project will involve taking input from the user and perform basic arithmetic operations(Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division).


## Dataset
This project does not involve the use of any Dataset.


## Tools/Application/Software/Packages Used For The Project
The Phyton Programming Language.


## Key Insights For Analysis/ Investigation
This project enhanced my skils in user input, functions and control structures in Phyton.


## Summary Of Findings
It is possible and simple to implement a simple calculator program in phyton using control structures and functions. The program worked efficiently.
